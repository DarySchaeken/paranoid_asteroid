Meeting monday 11H30: Alex, Alex, Yi Qing.

Unit testing for the game.
Give input, see output, just debugging, sort of.

Maybe a seperate file to print out all the info of the game in a 
seperate place/window.

Have to know if teacher require unit testing.

Alex Coco has to write java docs too.

We will eventually have to communicate between menu and game.

We have to double check if menu and game line up next week.

Payom will have to work on the saving part .
Do the save data ninary?
If binary changed a bit, then usefulness is lost.
Hex code must be intact.

But we only need to know if it is saving the game.
We have to save game state, high scores.
Game state and high scores saved SEPERATELY .

save to disc.
Game state is easiest to dump into binary.
Create a byte writer, byte reader.

reader return an object that needs to be casted.
