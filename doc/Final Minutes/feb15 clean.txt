Uncut notes taken during meeting:

Feb 15 2013
Start 5:45pm
Present members: ALL

So we got a meeting next week.

Software

ArogUML vs VISO2013 of microsoft?

We need to determine all the classes for the UML for the presentation.

We want a global general form of architecture.

So who to structure the architecture.

Coco already made like half of the game...
So we will probably go through his codes to write down the architecture.

Menu system, game, high score, pause menu, credits, options.

The rpesentation will be multiple small flow charts.

We should NOT show what Alex (C) has done until now.

How many asteroids?
Well, in Alex(C)'s asteroid version, 50 asteroids while collision is present actually 
lags the game a bit.
We still do not have aliens and the other features we wanted to add yet.

Use Java swing, or other graphic libraries?
Java effects?
For now, Alex C is using the standard one.

In the presentation, can we present the language and the libraries?
Too early.
We still haven't asked the teacher about Java Effects library.

The Architecture stuff will be high on graphics, low on texts.

The main things are on Alex C's git, since it is not a good idea to put it on
group git.

So for the meeting: we will just show what UML we got at that point,
then what libraries we are using, simple stuffs.
We need to follow all the quality requirements.
You dont show qqualtiy through class diagrams ...

Let's show up all suit up???
.... For the client ...

END TIME: 6:10pm
