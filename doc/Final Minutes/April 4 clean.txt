Uncut notes taken during meeting:

All present
start: 5:45pm

power point for the presentation.

Need to show a design process that we did in order to make the project.
100% Waterfall
Grey box testing??

Keep it clean and classic, using old graphics, not like the badgers.
We are RETRO style, with SOME bonus features which do NOT destroy original 
design of the game.

In our requirements, we casually say we set up these and those features.
We should say coupling a lot.
As a general thumb of rule, ...

Configuring the keys:
For a drop down menu, try to list from an array of keys, which is huge and ugly.
Maybe something more elegant.

We need to connect the configured keys to the actual listener keys.
Can be quite messy to deal with config.
Alex Coco suggests NO config, just use default key settings.
Not a priority

So 2 players coop might not be essential due to lack of time and been year 3 EE
students.




Maybe something more elegant.
