Uncut Notes taken during meeting:

Multi-threads:
Used only in rendering.
Maybe in soud effects.

"Entity" is an interface to allow the game_field to communicate
efficiently with all the smaller game entities.

Talk about modularity in the Analysis part of sad doc.

We are keeping the idea of making it more difficult as more advances in levels.

Fixed window size.

Storing functional positions as doubles for better precision in movement and collision 
detection.

Modularity for maintainability.  Must discuss like HOW is it modular.

each entity update its location for its polygone for graphical representation?

bullets generated by ship, bullets are ship objects.

The keylistener is giving to all classes.
Only one keylistener.
only one implement keylistener

The keylistener must has add and eliminate keys for the key changing possibility.

let's use alternation between argo and viso for UML.
